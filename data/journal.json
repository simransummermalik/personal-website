    "body": "<p>This event was super fun! Set up took forever but it was all worth it in the end. It was so fun trying to watch people present weird tech. Some super funny ones were a wifi dating app that matches you based on your wifi passwords, an IoT toothbrush that tells your dentist when youre lying, a quantum dating app and many many more! The whole lesson was to build soft skills and present something even when youre not passionate about it.It was funny to pair up random people and not just with the comfort of their friends, I think this meeting was a success. Something I would change is not scaring people a lot of people left because they did not want to participate so next meeting I think we might do something less nerve,wracking hopefully we continue to have a good turnout.</p>",
