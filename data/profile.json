  "about": "I absolutely love everything computer science—whether it's quantum computing, machine learning, bioinformatics, or just building cool stuff with code! Right now I'm leading QML Torch at Charlotte AI Research (building quantum-classical ML frameworks with PyTorch) and running HAVK, where we host bi-weekly online hackathons for 700+ students. There's nothing more exciting than watching people build amazing projects in 48 hours! Beyond coding, I'm obsessed with astrophysics and space—black holes, neutron stars, cosmology, all of it. I love exploring how computation helps us understand the universe, from quantum algorithms to analyzing cosmic data. If it involves solving hard problems, learning something new, or pushing the boundaries of what's possible with tech, I'm 100% there!",
