  "date": "2025-09-25",
  "summary": "Initial experimental lab for QML Torch — explored how quantum superposition and entanglement can conceptually extend classical nonlinear modeling.",
  "summary_long": "<p>This lab marked the first experimental step toward <strong>QML Torch</strong>, focusing on the conceptual interface between classical and quantum representations. The intent was not to optimize performance but to probe structure—to examine how superposition and entanglement can replicate or extend nonlinear transformations found in deep learning. Using <code>PennyLane</code> simulators on a standard laptop, the experiment mapped interference patterns to classical feature space, providing a tangible foundation for later hybrid differentiable circuits integrated with PyTorch autograd. This work defined the architectural language and intuition that will guide future hardware-connected implementations.</p>",

  "date": "2025-10-01",
  "summary": "Conceptual quantum reimagining of the classic XOR problem, inspired by the game XOR — built to show how quantum logic and interference patterns could replicate nonlinearity in ML decision spaces.",
  "summary_long": "<p>This lab extended the ideas behind <strong>QML Torch Activity One</strong> into a direct visual case study using the XOR dataset as both a classical benchmark and a conceptual testing ground for quantum structure. Inspired by the retro game <a href='https://www.crazygames.com/game/xor' target='_blank'>XOR</a>, this project explored how superposition and entanglement can act as information routing mechanisms, mirroring how nonlinear activations and feature crossings behave in classical deep learning.</p><p>Implemented fully on laptop-based simulators using <code>PennyLane</code> and <code>NumPy</code>, the experiment visualized the quantum circuit’s interference landscape as a differentiable decision surface. The focus was not on outperforming classical models, but on understanding how quantum transformations <em>encode logical nonlinearity without explicit activation functions</em>. The outcome served as both a teaching demo and a conceptual bridge toward hybrid layers that merge quantum data reuploading with PyTorch autograd.</p>",

  "title": "Quantum Key Distribution — BB84 Protocol Experiment",
  "date": "2025-10-21",
  "summary": "Experimental implementation of the BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol using Qiskit, exploring quantum randomness, measurement disturbance, and eavesdrop detection.",
  "summary_long": "<p>This activity introduced the <strong>BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)</strong> protocol as both a conceptual and practical demonstration of secure information exchange through quantum mechanics. The experiment used <code>Qiskit</code> within a Google Colab environment to simulate the full BB84 process: random bit generation, polarization basis encoding, and measurement-based decoding between sender (Alice) and receiver (Bob). The session was paired with an interactive presentation designed to make quantum security principles intuitive for new researchers.</p><p>Students implemented the protocol’s logic on a simulated quantum backend (<code>AerSimulator</code>), visualized eavesdropping effects, and examined how measurement disturbance exposes interception attempts. The goal was not cryptographic optimization but <em>physical understanding</em>—showing how the fundamental laws of measurement and superposition provide unbreakable security guarantees. This lab established the foundation for integrating QKD methods with the QML Torch pipeline, emphasizing experiment reproducibility and hands-on intuition for quantum information flow.</p>",

  "date": "2025-10-21",
  "summary": "Hands-on experiment demonstrating the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) using UNC Charlotte buildings to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem both classically and quantumly.",
  "summary_long": "<p>This meeting focused on applying <strong>QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)</strong> to a personalized version of the <em>Traveling Salesman Problem</em> (TSP) using real UNC Charlotte landmarks as nodes. The goal was to bridge classical and quantum optimization by encoding distances between buildings into a Hamiltonian energy model, allowing the quantum circuit to minimize path length as energy. Participants used <code>Qiskit</code> and <code>OR-Tools</code> to compare classical and quantum routes, demonstrating how both paradigms converge on similar solutions for small-scale problems.</p><p>The experiment introduced hybrid computation concepts: translating real data into <strong>QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)</strong> form, visualizing optimization landscapes, and tuning quantum parameters such as <em>reps</em>, <em>maxiter</em>, and <em>shots</em>. Each slider corresponded to physical and statistical properties of the circuit—depth, iteration accuracy, and noise averaging—offering a tangible view of how quantum-classical feedback loops operate in practice. The session emphasized that even when quantum solutions do not outperform classical ones, matching results validate correct problem mapping and experimental integrity.</p><p>This project built the foundation for the division’s next research phase: integrating <strong>quantum optimization pipelines</strong> into the broader QML Torch ecosystem. The team’s work mirrors how real-world institutions like IBM Quantum, Google, and NASA benchmark hybrid solvers—transforming theoretical quantum principles into reproducible, data-driven computation.</p>",
